This git repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science. The scripts includes implementations of binary trees, linked lists, heaps, and priority queues, as well as sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, bucket sort, and quicksort.

In addition to data structures and sorting, there are also implementations of graph algorithms such as depth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and an implementation of an undirected graph.
